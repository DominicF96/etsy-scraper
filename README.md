**Note: No Longer maintained, the package cannot be imported yet although the code works 'on my machine'.**

Retrieves info from Etsy using UrlLib and Beautiful Soup and returns the data in JSON.

**Note:** This is a web scraper, therefore, it will work until Etsy changes the tags we use to locate and
extract the different fields in the page. Be aware of that if you plan on using it in any large scale project.
Please see the Contribution section to help me keep it up-to-date!
